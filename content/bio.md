I am a PhD student at the School of School of Computation, Information and Technology (CIT), Technical University of Munich, advised by [Prof. Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/cv-nassir-navab/nassir-navab/).

Prior to this, I obtained two M.Sc. degrees with "Pass with Distinction" in Robotics and Medical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich (Germany), following the completion of my B.Eng. from Central South University (China).

My current research focuses on investigating machine learning in medical image analysis, medical image enhancement and intelligent medical Robotics in Intervention.

If you are a student from TUM and looking for an IDP, guided research, Bachelor or Master thesis in the fields of medical image understanding, AI-guided medical robotics, or medical image processing, feel free to contact us. We also welcome collaborations with students or researchers from other institutions who share an interest in these topics.
